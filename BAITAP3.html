    <p> <span style="color:brown">Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on theRoof Jr. such a
            smashing success!</span>After all of the hard work on
        rehearsals and set building and promotion, it really paid off. I have
        gotten so many comments on your wonderful performances.</p>

    <p>I've started putting up a <a href="slide1.html">slide show </a>of the
        production. Please feel free to download the files from the Web site.
        If you want high resolution photos on a photo CD, please
        contact me.</p>
